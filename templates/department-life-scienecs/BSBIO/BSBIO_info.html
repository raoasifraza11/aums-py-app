            <p align="justify" class="justify" >The study of life at the molecular level continues to undergo dynamic expansion, leading to
ever-increasing insights into topics as various as the origin of life, the nature of disease and
the development of individual organisms. Furthermore, advances in biochemistry are largely
responsible for the breakdown of traditional disciplinary boundaries between cell biology,
medicine, physics and chemistry.<br><br>
The Department of Life Sciences offers a 4-year BS Biochemistry degree program. The
department has adopted the HEC recommended curriculum that provides students with an
extensive exposure to basic Biochemistry, as well as to cell biology and molecular Bbiology.<br><br>
There is a huge scope and demand of Biochemistry in World. Employment opportunities for
biochemists are available in the chemical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, medical, forensic,
and rapidly expanding biotechnological fields.
