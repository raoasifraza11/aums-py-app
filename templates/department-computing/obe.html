            <h4>Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) for BSSE & BSCS</h4>
            <P>Program educational objectives describe the career and professional accomplishments that programs are preparing graduates to attain within a few years of graduation. Graduates will exhibit:</P>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Excellence in their career in Computer Science and related disciplines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Responsible team worker, professional ethics and effective communication skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Motivated professionals in pursuit of lifelong learning, career development, research, professional knowledge and entrepreneurship.

            <h4>Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) Mapping to Curriculum for BSCS</h4>
            <P>Program learning outcomes serve as a guide for students and faculty to ensure that our students are knowledgeable and competitive in their future professions. By the time of graduation, the program enables students to:</P>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline.</li>
                <li>Analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.</li>
                <li>Design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.</li>
                <li>Function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal.</li>
                <li>Understand professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Communicate effectively with a range of audience.</li>
                <li>Analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations and society.</li>
                <li>Recognize the need for, and an ability to engage in, continuing professional development.</li>
                <li>Use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.</li>
                <li>Apply mathematical foundation, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of tradeoffs involved in design choices.</li>
                <li>Apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.</li>

            </ol>

            <h4>Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) Mapping to Curriculum for BSSE</h4>
            <P>Program learning outcomes serve as guidelines that describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the knowledge, skills and attitude that the students acquire while progressing through the program:</P>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering.</li>
                <li>Design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data.</li>
                <li>Design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Function on multidisciplinary teams.</li>
                <li>Identify, formulate and solve engineering problems.</li>
                <li>Understand professional and ethical responsibility.</li>
                <li>Communicate effectively</li>
                <li>Understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental and societal context.</li>
                <li>Recognize the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning.</li>
                <li>Harness knowledge of contemporary issues.</li>
