                <p align="justify" class="justify">Education is the core value of a nation, and the function of an educational institution is not only to take care
                of an individual’s academic growth but also to take charge of his/her personal, social, mental, psychological,
                and spiritual maturity for overall learning and transformation. Only an institution which takes care of all
                these dynamics can shape a true scholar and a true professional, and Abasyn University is one of its kind
                in this realm.<br><br>
                    Abasyn University, established in 2007 through an Act of Provincial Assembly, has now emerged
                as a sustainable organization with the grace of Almighty and the committed efforts of the faculty and the
                management. Within a short span of time, the university has made a number of achievements including a thriving
                campus at Islamabad, and one in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE which will be operational as soon as HEC gives a green
                signal. <br><br>
                    This is heartening to know that apart from excelling in academic standards, students of Abasyn University
                actively participate in diverse socio-cultural activities of high standards such as tree plantation, traffic
                education, blood donation, youth awareness, and community service campaigns, drives, and projects to nurture
                exceptional values of social importance. The University, energized by its distinguished faculty and strengthened
                by its brilliant students, now stands in the highest echelons of education in the country and strives to
                forge new paths for a brighter tomorrow of Pakistan. I would like to congratulate the faculty and management
                of the University for their efforts being rewarded in terms of recognition of D-Pharmacy Discipline by the
                Pharmacy Council of Pakistan. This is going to be a historical year for Abasyn University as the university
                has planned its first convocation which will be held in May 2014, In-sha-Allah.
                    <br><br>I pray to Allah to crown
                our endeavors with success!
                    <br><br><strong>Dr. Muhammad Imran Ullah</strong></p></div>

                as excelling in both of these roles, and we intend to do even better - hence the ambitious program of investment

                University is to contribute to community through the pursuit of knowledge and patronage of quality education
                and thereby promoting and ensuring excellence in higher education in Pakistan. It is constantly seeking new
                vistas of wisdom and knowledge to stand out distinctly apart from the milling crowd of educational providers.
                The introduction of innovative and dynamic programs has proved to be the key factors in the perspective of
                lucrative placements. A bright opportunity is knocking at your door. Please come and tap it.<br><br>
                I request you to come and personally visit Abasyn University or go through this prospectus to know more about our academic
                environment, curriculum and teaching/learning proceedings.<br><br>

                and you will be able to play an important role for the development and prosperity of yourself, your family
